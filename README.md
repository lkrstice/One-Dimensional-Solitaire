# One-Dimensional-Solitaire
The one-dimensional Solitaire problem is a combinatorial problem. The objective is to determine the possible initial positions of the empty slot and the final positions where the remaining peg can end up. </br></br>
To solve the problem, a divide-and-conquer strategy is employed, and Depth-First Search (DFS) is used as the core algorithm. The solution has been implemented in the Python programming language.
